1,Data Scientist,Gurgaon,Builder.ai - What would you Build?,3.7,Company - Private,Enterprise Software & Network Solutions,Information Technology,₹527K - ₹798K (Glassdoor Est.),"About us

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild

The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries, while strengthening the capabilities of governments and the private sector in those countries to create and sustain high-quality health systems that can succeed without our assistance. For more information, please visit: http://www.clintonhealthaccess.org

CHAI, in partnership with its India affiliate William J Clinton Foundation (WJCF), works in close partnership with and under the guidance of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) at the Central and States’ levels on an array of high priority initiatives aimed at improving health outcomes. Currently CHAI/WJCF works across projects to expand access to quality care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis-C, tuberculosis, cancer and immunization.

Background

The world has not experienced a pandemic at the scale or pace of the current COVID-19 pandemic; the virus has ferociously attacked high- and low-income countries alike, but in so doing has exposed inequities in access to quality care within and across countries. Despite a proactive mitigation and stringent suppression strategy, the number of COVID cases in India continues to rise. While the indirect impacts of the COVID-19 on availability and utilization of routine health services cannot yet be known, lessons from previous crises suggest that service disruption and displacement will have grave impact on population health. In order to address these challenges, a robust response based on strengthened health workforce, resilient supply chains and rapid increase in diagnostic capacity is being spearheaded by the Ministry of Health and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

Program Overview

WJCF, in partnership with its affiliate CHAI, is supporting the COVID-19 response in the areas of testing policy, strengthened data and delivery systems, and development of guidelines. The programme has been supporting the ICMR in scaling up testing, providing data-driven insights to support supply chain management including forecasting and inventory management, and helping build guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for downstream distribution of commodities. Separately, the programme also supports selected states on localized strategies for testing scale up and equitable access, stronger engagement with the private sector, improved treatment readiness, robust awareness campaigns and capacity building initiatives, and analytics-based programme management.

Role

We seek a highly motivated individual with demonstrated analytical abilities for the role of Data Scientist based at Delhi.

247,Machine Learning Engineer,Other,Expand AI,4.5,,,,₹522K - ₹823K (Glassdoor Est.),"With supervised learning in Machine Learning (ML) having access to high-quality training datasets is essential to train ML algorithms effectively. Yet, the industry standard for producing these high-quality training datasets is to use human annotators who usually produce these datasets by hand. The main reason why this is the industry standard is that usually with an expert annotator who has the right domain knowledge the accuracy level for these training datasets is usually very high (99% or above) which is essential to train ML algorithms effectively. Otherwise, you could crowdsource the data to a crowdsourcing platform but then the accuracy level usually isn’t very high with this method. However, the two major downsides with these approaches are that the turnaround time for the datasets is usually very high. It could take weeks or months depending on the volume of the data. Moreover, because it’s done manually the cost is usually exorbitantly high.
In order to solve this huge data bottleneck that the ML pipeline faces we are building a program that will programmatically generate training datasets. The main challenge will be to keep the accuracy level at 99% or more but the turnaround time will come down significantly. We are talking about hours or even minutes over time and because it’s done programmatically the cost will be exorbitantly low.
This is a hard problem to solve, hence why there isn’t any go-to solution for this in the market yet. This is why I am looking for capable ML Engineers who will join our team to contribute towards solving this pressing issue that will help accelerate the growth of ML and AI applications in various industries and in consumer tech products throughout India.
Here are the specifications required for the job: You should have demonstrated interest and passion in ML/DL/AI in college through projects, internships, and/or research work. Work experience with ML and AI is also great. You should be well-versed in PyTorch and Python and other DL languages and applications. You should preferably be a hard-core ML/DL/AI person but even someone with knowledge of generative models, discriminative models, and other ML models is welcome to apply. You should be someone with the drive to complete a complicated task really well in 1/3 the time that most competent people deem possible and should have the drive to do important work that will put India on the map with ML and AI.
You will be working with some of the smartest people from IITs and other leading tech institutions to devise a solution to this hard problem.
If you want to be a part of this tectonic shift in AI, send in your application and I look forward to reviewing it.

398,Data Analyst,Bangalore,Drishti,3.6,Company - Private,Enterprise Software & Network Solutions,Information Technology,₹243K - ₹475K (Glassdoor Est.),"Join Drishti to solve a 100-year-old problem for a $12 trillion dollar industry.
Deep learning-driven action recognition is the next frontier for AI. Build it with us.
Drishti’s mission is to “extend human potential in an increasingly automated world”. For the first time since Henry Ford, we’re making manual processes visible to factory analytics—by creating manufacturing’s first and only solution for deep learning-driven action recognition.
About this role
A key part of Drishti is looking at mix of factory data and generating domain specific reports and analytics for the clients. A data analyst will understand the manufacturing domain and client context, and work with a mix of data from different sources, and create relevant reports.
Minimum Qualification
Ability to look at & analyse data using a set of tools – including excel, and python-based stack such as Pandas, R, and other tools
2+ years of experience with data analytics across domains – either inhouse in data team of a product company or with services organization
Prior experience with data ETL pipelines, setting them on snowflake / redshift / any other stack
Strong database concepts, including data modeling, SQL schema design & SQL queries
Experience with NoSQL / Mongo databases
1+ years of experience in Python
Bachelors in Computer Science / EE / Maths
Ability to pick up application of data in different domains
Understanding of concepts around time series, clustering, classification

Requirements:

Preferred Qualification
Certificate or courses done on data analytics on coursera, edX or others
Experience in manufacturing or applied context is a bonus
Five reasons to work at Drishti
Work with visionaries who can execute: Our leadership team is comprised of heavy hitters from the AI and deep learning world. Check out their patents and publications, and see how their histories intertwine with the biggest movements in the last 30 years of technology. And imagine being on a first-name basis with them, solving hard technical problems side-by-side.
Tackle a massive market challenge: Manufacturing is a $12T industry that still uses 100-year-old techniques to gather data on human tasks. Which means that people, who still perform nearly 75 percent of factory activities, are effectively invisible to analytics. This situation severely hinders the decision-making abilities of the world’s largest manufacturing brands. The demand for a solution couldn’t be larger.
Do what you love – solve problems using tech: A problem of this magnitude requires the full force of technological solutions. You’ll take on neural network model accuracy, high-volume video transit and storage, Big Data analysis and much more. It’s the challenge – and the madness, and the fun – of building an SAP on top of a YouTube on top of a Nest.
Lead the charge from Bangalore: Drishti is series B funded Silicon Valley-based startup and funded by top venture capital investors that include Andreessen Horowitz, Emergence Capital, BGV, Sozo Ventures, Toyota AI Ventures etc. But – and this is critical for you – Drishti is building its product out of Bangalore. From our CTO on down, Bangalore is the heart and soul of Drishti’s engineering. You’ll be at the centre of the action.
Get exposure to deep learning: Deep learning technology is fundamental to what we do, and select engineers at Drishti have the opportunity to rotate into our deep learning group, to work alongside some of the foremost experts in the field.",243,475,359.0,Private,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,Other,Analyst,Other,Software,Information Technology
